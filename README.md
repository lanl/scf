# Description
**SCF: Seismicity-Constrained Fault Detection and Characterization**

![2D examples](doc/example.png)

Fault detection and characterization is one of center challenges in subsurface characterization. We develop a seismicity-constrained fault detection and characterization based on a multitask machine learning model to leverage both seismic migration image and seismicity location information. The repository contains codes associated with the ML models and the codes for generating training data.

The work was supported by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Laboratory Directory Research and Development (LDRD) project 20240322ER. LANL is operated by Triad National Security, LLC, for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. 89233218CNA000001. The research used high-performance computing resources provided by LANL's Institutional Computing program.

The work is under LANL open source approval reference O4809.

# Requirement
`SCF` is written with Python, PyTorch, and PyTorch Lightning. Please install these package first. Other than that, `SCF` is self-consistent.

The data generation depends on [RGM](https://github.com/lanl/rgm). `RGM` depends on [FLIT](https://github.com/lanl/flit).

We train the 2D models with a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3090). However, to train the 3D models, you will need multiple supercomputing-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100), each with more than 40GB memory.


# Use
```
cd scf2
bash run_train.sh
```

or

```
cd scf3
bash run_train.sh
```
